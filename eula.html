            <p class="updated"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

            <p>This End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a legal agreement between you ("<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>User</strong>") and <strong>Core Arc Studio LLC</strong> ("<strong>Core Arc Studio</strong>," "<strong>AnnotateAudio</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") governing your use of the AnnotateAudio mobile application and related services (collectively, the "<strong>App</strong>" or "<strong>Service</strong>"). (<a href="https://annotateaudio.com">annotateaudio.com</a>)</p>

            <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Content"</strong> means audio files you upload, transcripts, speaker labels, summaries, translations, chat/Q&A outputs, and any other materials generated, stored, or displayed through the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>"Apple"</strong> means Apple Inc. and its subsidiaries (where the App is obtained from the Apple App Store).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required where you live) to use the Service. The Service is not intended for children under 13.</p>

            <h2>3. Account and Authentication</h2>
            <p>The Service may require an account. We use one-time passcodes (OTP) to authenticate users; you do not need to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of access to your email account and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

            <h2>4. License Grant</h2>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the App on Apple-branded products that you own or control, as permitted by the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions and applicable law.</p>

            <h2>5. Subscriptions, In-App Purchases, and Billing</h2>
            <p>If the App offers subscriptions or in-app purchases ("<strong>IAP</strong>"):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payments are processed by the app store provider (e.g., Apple).</li>
                <li>Subscription terms, pricing, renewal, free trials (if any), and cancellation are managed through your app store account settings.</li>
                <li>Except where required by law, payments are non-refundable and credits are not provided for partially used periods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Your Content</h2>

            <h3>6.1 Ownership</h3>

            <h3>6.2 Permission to Process Your Content</h3>
            <p>You grant us a limited license to host, store, process, transmit, reproduce, and display your Content <strong>solely</strong> to provide and operate the Service (e.g., uploading, storing, playback, generating transcripts, speaker labels, summaries, translations, and chat outputs, and showing them to you in the App).</p>

            <h3>6.3 Responsibility for Your Content</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Your Content and your use of the Service comply with applicable laws (including recording/consent laws, privacy laws, and intellectual property laws).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring you have consent to record and upload audio where required.</p>

            <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree not to (and not to help anyone else):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Service for unlawful purposes or in violation of recording/consent, privacy, or intellectual property laws.</li>
                <li>Upload Content that you do not have the rights to use.</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code or underlying models from the App (except where prohibited by law).</li>
                <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, accounts, or systems.</li>
                <li>Use the Service to develop, test, or benchmark competing products without our written permission.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may remove Content or suspend/terminate accounts for violations.</p>

            <h2>8. AI Outputs and Limitations</h2>
            <p>The Service may produce transcripts and other AI-generated outputs (speaker labels, summaries, translations, and chat responses). These outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible for verifying outputs before relying on them for important decisions. We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

            <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Service may rely on third-party infrastructure providers to host and operate features (for example, cloud providers). Those providers process data on our behalf only to provide services to us.</p>
            <p>Your use of third-party services may be subject to their separate terms.</p>

            <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our collection and use of information is described in our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, which is incorporated by reference:<br>
            <strong><a href="https://annotateaudio.com/privacy.html">https://annotateaudio.com/privacy.html</a></strong></p>

            <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The App, Service, software, design, trademarks, and all related intellectual property rights are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable laws. Except for the limited license granted in Section 4, no rights are granted to you.</p>

            <h2>12. Feedback</h2>
            <p>If you submit suggestions or feedback, you grant us the right to use it without restriction or compensation, and without any obligation to you.</p>

            <h2>13. Termination</h2>
            <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate this Agreement or if we reasonably believe your use creates risk or legal exposure.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, the license in Section 4 ends and you must stop using the App.</p>

            <h2>14. Deletion of Content and Accounts</h2>
            <p>You can delete individual files (audio, transcripts, and related outputs) and you can delete your account. We delete from active systems, though backup copies may persist for a limited period due to standard backup/disaster recovery processes.</p>

            <h2>15. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.</p>

            <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</li>
                <li>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE <strong>12 MONTHS</strong> BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR <strong>$10</strong> IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING), UNLESS APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES A GREATER AMOUNT.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
